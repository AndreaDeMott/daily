====================

8:00 Homework Review
--------------------

* Show that you have directories made for `~/cheatsheets`, `~/waypoints`, and `~/reflections`
* Files for the two "Little Book of Talent" reflections (Tips 4 and 11)
* Be able to do the vim waypoint in 3 minutes or less.

**Quiz**

* These ones have right answers.
  * What does it mean for a command to have a dollar sign in front of it?
  * What is a directory?
  * What is the command to change directories?
  * What is the command to make a directory?
  * What is the command to list the contents of a directory?
  * What is the command to start vim with a file?
  * What weird symbol is used to represent your home directory?
  * What are the two vim modes, and what are they for? (keep it terse)
  * What strings would these match? You can see a visualization at [http://regexper.com/](http://regexper.com/)
    * `ab[cd]ef`
    * `ab[cd]ef[gh]ij`
* These ones, the right answer is that you're not talking giberish
  * What patterns do you see in the JSON structures below? (find the balance between terse and descriptive)
  * Ignoring that the data *looked* different, how many different structures of data were there?
    ie if you were to make up your syntax (format of characters that make up the data, ie "then you have to have a comma"),
    how many different types of data would you have to make up syntax for?
  * If I said "There is a gem named Rails, written by David Heinemeier Hansson, that has been downloaded
    60,439,139 times, and is on version 4.2.5.1", what would the JSON structure for that maybe look like?


Scattered Throughout the Day
----------------------------

TODO: Move this explanation off somewhere into curriculum.
Purpose of tools:
  Get them comfortable with their environment Ie what are files, programs, the shell, the terminal,
  how to run a program, how to navigate the file system.
  They will spend an exorbitant amount of time in this environment,
  so they need to be comfortable enough with it that it fades away and lets them focus on the challenge they are trying to solve.

* Typing practice
* Vim practice
* File system practice
* Run the SiB commands.


8:30 Seeing Is Believing
------------------------

[https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/structures_for_representing_nouns.md](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/structures_for_representing_nouns.md)

The structures we made up.

* Name
* SKU (stock keeping unit)
* Coin Flip
* Warehouses
* Boxes
* Floor space


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Catered by MBurger


1:00 Continue Structures for Representing nouns / Cheatsheets
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Continue working on the cheatsheets
* Create your own
* Add a reflection in `~/reflections/core_structures` where you
  answer the questions in the reflect section.


The Power and Danger of Abstractions
------------------------------------

[Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/the_power_and_danger_of_abstractions.md)

The structures we learned today will serve us very well.
They give us an ability to understand relationships that is incredibly powerful.
But always keep in mind, when learning any abstraction,
that there are ways it is not true, and there are costs to using it.
For now, the advantages tremendously outweigh the disadvantages,
but when you have demonstrated competence with them, you can ask me how they work,
and we will go to a land where they do not exist.
Pop open the hood and understand how they work.


4:30 - 6:30 Mentor meetings
---------------------------

If your mentor is here, meet with them,
establish a good time and place to
work with your mentor, and a good place.


Homework
--------

* Repeat yesterday's [vim waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_first_steps.md)
  (less than 5 min)
* Do this other [vim "waypoint"](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_bare_minimum.md)
  (it's longer than I'd like waypoints to be, but w/e)
* Make a cheatsheet for "unix", and add in explanations and examples of how to use each of these.
  Don't look at documentation. You can look at material we've given you, but mostly you should figure out how they work by
  experimenting with them, hypothesize how they work, trying some examples that should and should not be true.
  Use science to figure out how it works :) Don't worry if you're correct or not, according to someone else's statement,
  it is more valuable to make sense of it yourself than it is to be objectively correct. That will come with time, regardless,
  but your understanding will be much much deeper.

  * `pwd`
  * `cd`
  * `ls`
  * `rm`
  * `ln`
  * `mkdir`
  * `curl`
  * And I haven't told you this one yet, but there is a program named `cat`.  It expects filenames as arguments.
* What would `12[abc]67` match?
* Banking Problems
The problems are graduated; each one builds on the previous one.  
Write and test your code for each step, and don't move on to the next step
until you are satisfied that it works properly and you know why. 

Joe has a bank account containing $250
Sally has a bank account containing $4,000
Implement the names as strings and the account balances as integers.

Step 1:  Write a Ruby program to deposit money in Sally's bank account:
a.  output the beginning balance in Sally's account
b.  add $200 to the balance
c.  output the updated balance.
Submit this program as Banking-1.rb

Step 2:  Write a Ruby program to deposit money in Sally's bank account:
a.  output the beginning balance in Sally's account
b.  read in an amount from the user at the keyboard and add it to the balance
c.  output the updated balance.
d.  What if the user types in hotdog for the amount to be added?  Make the program handle such
input gracefully.
Submit this program as Banking-2.rb

Step 3:  Let's make this more realistic.  Write a Ruby program that outputs Sally's bank account
as $4000.00, not as 4000
a.  implement this change by modifying the output only; don't modify the data type of the account 
balance, which should remain an integer.
b.  Extra challenge (optional):  output the balance with commas preceding every 3 digits, so that
Sally's balance is output as $4,000.00
Submit this program as Banking-3.rb

Step 4:  Implement the bank accounts as key/value pairs (hashes) 
containing the account holder's name (key) and the amount in the account (value).  
Create an array of hashes and add a few more accounts to your liking (e.g. Wanda, $2) to the array.
Write a Ruby program to mimic a bank teller:
a.  read in the account holder's name
b.  output account holder's name and the beginning balance in the account 
c.  read in an amount to be deposited
d.  output account holder's name and the updated balance
e.  What if the user enters a name that is not associated with an account?  Make the program handle this gracefully.
Submit this program as Banking-4.rb

Step 5:  The accounts even in this rudimentary bank should be able to handle dollars and cents!  Implement the
account balances not as integers, but as numbers containing decimal places. 
a.  make all necessary changes to your program from Step 4.
Submit this program as Banking-5.rb

Step 6:  In your program from Step 5, define a method named deposit.  This method:
  * accepts only one parameter, which is the amount to be deposited
  * adds the amount to be deposited to the account balance
  * and that's all it does.
Output the account holder's name and the updated balance in the main body of the program,
not in the deposit method.
a.  doing this will cause lots of problems...what are they, and why do they occur?
Write a couple of lines/paragraphs describing what's going wrong and the reasons for it (and, 
if possible, the solutions.)
Submit this explanation as Banking-6.md

Extra challenge (optional):  At the end of the fiscal year, even our bank must do some accounting.  
In your program from Step 5, add up the balances in all of the accounts, and output this sum.
Submit this program as Banking-7.rb
