Here's where we explained the purpose and format:
[Video](https://vimeo.com/155432833)

While working on your HTTP parser,
I'll pull you aside for assessments (15-30 min),
in the following order:

1. Greg
1. Javi
1. Matthew
1. Derreck
1. Sean
1. Vince
1. Megan
1. Dongmin
1. James

One of these will be chosen at random,
I'll watch you perform it in under 2 minutes:

* [echo](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/echo.md)
* [cat](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cat.md)
* [cp](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cp.md)
* [rm](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/rm.md)
* [sleep](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/sleep.md)
* [ls](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/ls.md)

And then do the
[medusa mythical creature](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/blob/5f1e8b8afad8a05ff9c7b5a55801578b85ae42e0/mythical-creatures/medusa_test.rb),
including implementing the missing tests.
I'll probably toss another challenge in there, too :P
