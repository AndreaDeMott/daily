8:00 How to use git for pairing on a project
--------------------------------------------

You should have one repository that everyone on your team commits to.

[Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/how_to_use_git_for_pairing_on_a_project.md)

Git game results:

1. James/Javi/Megan
2. Matthew/Sean/Greg
3. Vince/Dongmin/Derreck

If anyone's `gh` doesn't work, for example, find me during work time!


9:30 Work Time
--------------

When you have "work time" today, spend it on either
[building a gem day 3](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/building-a-gem/Day3.md),
or on [your project](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/notes-project.md).
Building a gem has the same structure and workflow as the one
you're working on, in fact, it's a harder program to write than the one you're doing.
So mine it heavily for ideas.

* Matthew, Greg, Sean
* Megan, James, Javi
* Derreck, Dongmin, Vince


11:00 Simple Regexes
--------------------

These will make your acceptance test more robust!

* 30 min figuring some out
* 30 min writing down examples of useful ones for yourself.
* If only you had a notes progam you could put your examples into O.o
