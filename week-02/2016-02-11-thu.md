[Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/ruby_ecosystem.md)

Nokogiri Challenge
------------------

[Here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e2d3e0a0a441668492aa) is our solution!

Figure out how Nokogiri works using pry,
google, and some good old intuition!

* Write a program that gets the cast list from [Deadpool](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast)
* Bonus: Get the cast members' pictures

and you'll need to get nokogiri:

```
$ gem install nokogiri
```

And here's just enough to get you started:

```ruby
require 'nokogiri'
url = 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1431045/fullcredits?ref_=tt_cl_sm#cast'
# ?? You'll need to get information off the internet (ask Greg, he figured it out yesterday)
page = Nokogiri::HTML(html_string)
# ?? You'll need to get information out of the page, use the pry and look around and guess a lot!
require "pry"
binding.pry
```
