8:00 Vim
--------

Show `gg` and `G`, add to your git cheatsheet, practice all known commands.


8:15 Pry
--------

[Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/pry-intro.md)

8:45 Git
--------

* The basic workflow.
* Watch me put the metrics from yesterday on github
* Each person put your error generation results on github.


10:15 Work on your typing for 15 minutes
----------------------------------------

* [Prework](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/prework-practice-typing.md)
* [Tutor](https://www.typingclub.com)


10:30 Share waypoints
---------------------

Josh: Talk to Jake Worth, about the Hashrocket TDD/Pairing workshop.
Full day, Wednesday the 17th would be great for a full day workshop on TDD

Students: Split up into groups of three. Each person take 10 minutes to share your waypoint that you worked on and allow the group to ask questions.
Then 20 minutes to get the others person through the waypoint. Then rotate. Do this until all three have shared.


12:00 Choose a practice perfect participlant
--------------------------------------------

```ruby
%w[Dongmin vince greg james megan derreck javi sean matthew].sample
```


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Eat some veggies. Except Vince, eat some Chipotle!


10:00 Practice Perfect review
-----------------------------


10:15 Unix: things I give my children
-------------------------------------

Topics: environment variables, pipes,
redirecting input/output


Ruby: things my parents gave me
-------------------------------

Topics: $stdin, $stdout, $stderr, ARGV, ENV


Error generation
----------------

Make groups of three using this code:

```
%w[Dongmin vince greg james megan derreck javi sean matthew].shuffle.each_slice(3).to_a
```

One person put your result on github.

And consolidate your solutions to generating the errors [here](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/make_a_program_that_blows_up_like_this.md).
Go with the shortest examples of each. Do this as quickly as you can (ie "does it raise the error"? and then "which is shortest?")

Then the three groups consolidate your code into the shortest example you can get.


Homework
--------

* Wear loose comfortable clothing tomorrow.
* Practice your waypoint until you have it down solid and then make a video
  (who knows how to make a video that will work for everyone?)
* Object model questions
* Practice typing

### Make me a waypoint so I don't have to

Here are the easy options:

* touch
* mv
* rm
* sleep
* tr
* ls
* which

Or, if you want to challenge yourself:

* ag/grep
* sort
* wc
