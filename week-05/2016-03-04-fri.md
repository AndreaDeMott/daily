====================

Vote on challenges you'd like me to add... Blocks it is!

8:00 Consolidation of topics
----------------------------

As a group:

* Finish consolidating the topics you started on yesterday.
* Put them in a consumable format so you can access them when you need them.
* Compose an email to the mentors showing them what topics we've covered.


Work on challenges & get them on Github
---------------------------------------

Derreck and some other people know how to
get your challenges on Github and still be able to pull mine.
If yours aren't up there, then ask them how to do it :)

In the interim, work on challenges!
