8:00 Work on project
--------------------

I'll be over here :)

[notes](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/cheatsheets/blob/master/retro-10-march-2016.md)

12:00 Lunch
-----------

Eat some stuff.


1:30 Install Mysql
------------------

Hopefully:

```sh
$ brew install mysql
$ brew cask install mysqlworkbench
```

If that doesn't work, there's a download page [here](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).



3:00 Yoga
---------

Wear loose comfortable clothing.
The mats are kindly provided by the veteran's yoga project,
if you think the experience has value, consider [donating](http://www.veteransyogaproject.org/donate.html),
or sending them a "thanks" on [twitter](https://twitter.com/veteransyoga).


4:00 Watch Josh TDD example
---------------------------

On our old friend, the [notes project](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/8b680058e3337fbcf7f4d82d9f45bd3e1860b3a0/phase1/notes-project.md)
Also note that this is a very similar process as to how I did the server
you are currently working on, when we were at Chicago Ruby ([link](https://vimeo.com/157390424)).


5:00 Trip to Enova to Pair with their Devs
