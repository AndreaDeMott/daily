=======================

We have to make a decision!

9:00 Project Primer
-------------------

Bare minimums to be able to make Iterable

* Give a block
* Get a block
* Use a module (Comparable)
* Define a module

People doing challenges:

If anyone is willing to look through the videos and dailies so far,
and identify topics and so forth that we can make challenges for,
that would be really heplful!

9:30 Make some challenges
-------------------------

* blocks
* modules
* 2 or 3 recursions (list count recursively is fun!), (fibonacci?!)




The old plan (prob doesn't matter)
----------------------------------

* Improvement assessments
* Give the Iterable project (due Tues)
* map in our linked list
* refactor join to use map
* Modules (include / namespacing)
* Reflection 30 min
* extract map into Iterable
* include Iterable into the list
* Implement an enumerable object
* Meditation?
