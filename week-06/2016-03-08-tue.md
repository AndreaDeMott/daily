Constraint: You can work on your challenge *after* each member of your group
shows me that they can perform the [HTTP waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/http.md).

Get together with your group, make sure you're on the same page,

think will be most valuable for your group.
