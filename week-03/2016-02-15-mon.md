---------------------------

[Video](https://vimeo.com/155432833)

The purpose of these is to give you a sense of where you're at,
to give us a sense of where you're at, and make sure we've
adequately covered the material. We may also add customized work for
you to address weak skills.

Friday, we'll have an assessment, during the assessment,
you'll have to do one of the Unix waypoints from this list.
You need to do it in under 2 minutes:

* [echo](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/echo.md)
* [cat](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cat.md)
* [cp](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cp.md)
* [rm](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/rm.md)
* [sleep](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/sleep.md)
* [ls](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/ls.md)

And one of the ruby exercises, selected at random
from this list:

**GET A LIST!!**
