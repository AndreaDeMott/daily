10:30 Share waypoints
---------------------

Students: Split up into groups of three. Each person take 10 minutes to share your waypoint that you worked on and allow the group to ask questions.
Then 20 minutes to get the others person through the waypoint. Then rotate. Do this until all three have shared.

3:45 Error generation
---------------------

Make groups of three using this code:

```
%w[Dongmin vince greg james megan derreck javi sean matthew].shuffle.each_slice(3).to_a
```

One person put your result on github.

And consolidate your solutions to generating the errors [here](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/make_a_program_that_blows_up_like_this.md).
Go with the shortest examples of each. Do this as quickly as you can (ie "does it raise the error"? and then "which is shortest?")

Then the three groups consolidate your code into the shortest example you can get.
