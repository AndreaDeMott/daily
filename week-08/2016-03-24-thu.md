A video
-------

Something I've been thinking about lately, and reflecting on: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMPzDiraNnA)

Play!

[Context](https://vimeo.com/160152647)

Explore, play, fail! Delight in the new,
try things that matter to you!

Don't forget that I'm here to aid,
would you like challenges or waypoints to be made?
Would you like a class, structure, imposition of grades?
Let me know, and that's what I'll do,
I'm not in charge, I'm a resource for you!

Some thoughts!

* Would anyone like to build a blog for either yourself, or all of us to upload our thoughts to?
  That would be really cool!
* Is anyone interested in doing [Rails playgrounds](https://github.com/JoshCheek/playgrounds)?
* If you want to do a checkin for a project, let me know and we'll schedule one!
* [This](http://codepen.io/alexmwalker/pen/paHcG) CSS thing looks amazing!
  I had no idea you could do stuff like that with CSS!
  I kind of want to try it out, interested in trying it out with me?
* CSS layouts are hard, but they have this thing now called "flexbox" which makes it way easier.
  There's some games
  [1](http://flukeout.github.io/),
  [2](http://www.sitepoint.com/11-css-learning-tools-and-resources/)
  about how to get it laid out.
  Want to come up with a crazy layout and see if we can't get it figured out, then try the games to fill in the gaps?
* What's a vim thing you've seen me do that you want to learn?
  What's an editing task that's annoyed you that we could try to find a way to address?
* What's something you previously struggled with that you want to give another go?
* Can you still write all the linked list functions?
* I'm at Starbucks right now, it's a beautiful calm morning, you should try working out of here!
* Do you want to make a waypoint out of that server? It may have taken you 2 weeks, but think how much you learned along the way.
  All the things I was bad at, I practiced until I was good at them.
  You could get that thing that took you two weeks down to 30 minutes O.o
  Seriously, we could do that.
* [This](http://codingbat.com/) site has some amazing challenges for Java and Python (I like the Java ones best)
  I could teach you just enough Java to get started with it.
  I learned *sooooo* much by going through that one!
  To the point that I even styled the challenges after it!

For a few of you humans
-----------------------

* Megan, [here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/4574453) is a minimal example of how to make a C extension!
  If you get that working, we can look at how to import your strings and expose the data to Ruby.
* Javi, [here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/1bf40c3e44f3347295d5) is an example of how to make your own ActiveRecord!
* James, [here](http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/net/Net/FTP) is code in the stdlib for
* Sean eye exams
* Derreck, would you like to present what you've been learning today?
* Vince, [here](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/) are some resources on Django,
  do you want to try learning that today? I'll give it a shot with you!
  [Here](http://codingbat.com/python) is some material to help teach you Python and algorithmic thinking,
  both of those would be relevant!

If I haven't thought of something interesting for you,
do you have anything you're interested in that I could help with?
Come tell me stories about your excitement!


A challenge for you
-------------------

If you like, and only if it is interesting to you, go for a walk.
Just take 30 minutes to walk today, to feel the rain, and to notice the city.
Notice the people around you, the way the lamps line up down the street and shine in the fog.
Notice the patterns of the rain on the wet sidewalk.
