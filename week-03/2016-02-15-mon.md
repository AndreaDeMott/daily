Read The Little Book of Talent tip #8 and reflect.
I'm not here to release a bunch of mediocre devs into the world.


10:30 Practice waypoints

2:00 Assessment Explanation
---------------------------

[Video](https://vimeo.com/155432833)

The purpose of these is to give you a sense of where you're at,
to give us a sense of where you're at, and make sure we've
adequately covered the material. We may also add customized work for
you to address weak skills.

Friday, we'll have an assessment, during the assessment,
you'll have to do one of the Unix waypoints from this list.
You need to do it in under 2 minutes:

* [echo](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/echo.md)
* [cat](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cat.md)
* [cp](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cp.md)
* [rm](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/rm.md)
* [sleep](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/sleep.md)
* [ls](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/ls.md)

And one of the ruby exercises, selected at random
from this list:

**GET A LIST!!**

* `hobbit_test.rb`
* `pirate_test.rb`
* `wizard_test.rb`
* `medusa_test.rb`
* `werewolf_test.rb`
* `centaur_test.rb`


2:00 Homework Review
--------------------

* [Video](https://vimeo.com/155445994) walking through the test
* [Video](https://vimeo.com/155445993) walking through how solution works

The [mythical creatures](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises) exercises.
Easy? Hard? Where did you get stuck?
Lets figure that stuff out.


3:00 break
----------

Use it wisely.


3:25 Object Model Challenges
----------------------------

Continue from where we left off [here](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/ad9f70a6d855be9ed50d).


4:00 Group review
-----------------

Come back and ask questions about the object model challenges, we'll answer them together.


4:30 Synseer and homework
-------------------------

* verify they did synseer challenges
* release new synseer challenges
* Describe homework

Homework
--------

* Get 10 synseer challenges to 0 seconds
* Complete all new synseer challenges
* Improve the world for one person around you
* 3 constraints:
  * Solve the Centaur from [mythical creatures](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises/tree/master/mythical-creatures)
    in three different ways. You should have three different Centaur classes, each of which
    passes the test suite.
  * Using instance variables (the "normal" way)
  * Only a single instance variable, whose value is an array
  * Only a single instance variable, whose value is a hash
* Put your various repositories in `code` onto github.
  ie your solutions to the mythical creatures and your
  unix programs (probably have all the unix programs in the same dir).
  We're trying to build you a portfolio of work, this will be helpful :)
