=====================

To Organized:

* Representing nouns Recap yesterday's material (JSON data structures) and then use the tools to render lots of examples in JSON. I'm thinking some English phrases, get them to recognize that plurality implies a collection, nonexistence implies nil/null, anything with a name implies a hash, words imply strings, yes/no implies true/false, etc. Then have them model many of the things they are using. eg the file system, HTML, HTTP, etc. So they will build competence with this skill while also learning about these domains. This will reduce the scariness / newness of those systems. I generally want to avoid teaching them topics in favour of teaching them techniques so they can teach themselves the topic.

* Linked Lists If they understand the JSON data structures, then this is an opportunity to use that knowledge of modeling. A linked list is a very useful data structure to understand, and it's very simple. You can represent it with arrays [1, [2, [3, nil]]] or hashes: {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}} or give it a base to wrap the nodes: {head: {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}}}. Then have them play with it to show they can get any arbitrary piece of data out, or put new pieces of data in. Do this in SiB, where feedback is effective. Then have them build methods to abstract the process. Maybe have them build a stack out of it, to prepare for the object model.


9:00 Teambuilding

With Len Harris.


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Catered by LETTUCE / Big City Chicken.

(Josh will be out)


4:00 - 5:00 Military to Coding
------------------------------

Ray Krueger's personal story.

Homework
--------

* Add a reflection in `~/reflections/my_core_structures` where you
  describe the representation that you made up.
  Be sure to explain the difference between the syntax and the semantics.
* Use the structures we defined today to describe the structures you see in each of these.
  Bonus points if you can come up with multiple representations.

  * `$ echo $PATH`
  * `$ curl -i http://google.com'
  * A url with query parameters (eg search for something on Amazon.com)
