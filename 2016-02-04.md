=====================

To be organized:

* Ruby's object model. The simple / elegant explanation of how Ruby works, based on three structures. They can understand the stack because it's just a linked list. They can understand inheritance, because it's just a linked list. I'll give them the main 3 structures and then tons of questions and challenges that they can only answer by using the model (the 3 structures). If they do well at this, they will know how Ruby works better than many people who've been writing it for years. I might also give them tools for reflection, so they can query the system to get feedback to validate their thoughts.
* Does Andrea want to do the HTTP uploading here?
