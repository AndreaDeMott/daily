Lets set up our sockets again, but with a focus on mindfulness about our relationship to the client and server.

3:00 Project work time
----------------------

Constraint: You can work on your challenge *after* each member of your group
shows me that they can perform the [HTTP waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/http.md).

Get together with your group, make sure you're on the same page,
that your things are pushed, and you feel comfortable with what you have,
and with where you're going next. Choose from the challenges, what you
think will be most valuable for your group.


2:00 Checkins
-------------

Once your group has all shown that you can perform the HTTP waypoint,
and you're ready for a checkin, come by for feedbackz.
