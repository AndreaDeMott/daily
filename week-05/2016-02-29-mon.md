====================


NEW RULES
---------

1. Stay in the root of your project (the dir with test, lib, bin)
2. Run your tests with `$ mrspec` from the root of your project.

Once you can reliably do these things (ie your code doesn't break
nondeterministically, for reasons you don't understand),
then you may break them.


8:00 Submit Linked Lists
------------------------

Make sure linked list projects are committed and pushed,
send me the links so I can submit them for code review.


8:15 Dotfiles improvements
--------------------------

* Set copy/paste to run from your clipboard:
  [link](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles-for-students/commit/0af45bc#diff-076d61938d25fd036d6436c94d8778faR33)
* Run SeeingIsBelieving without having to press "return" after `<Leader>b`

8:30 Project Time / Checkins
----------------------------

We'll do checkins:

* 8:30 - Derreck, Dongmin, Vince
* 8:50 - Matthew, Greg, Sean
* 9:10 - Megan, James, Javi


10:30 Blocks
------------

30 min for Blocks and Control Flow (line nums)
And then 15 min writing down notes / explanation / example to make blocks make sense.


11:00 `LinkedList#each` and `#join`
-----------------------------------

First try writing an `#each` method, that uses a while loop to access each element, by its index:

```ruby
def my_each(array, &block)
  # ???
end

array = [100, 'abc', 200, 'def']
my_each array do |element|
  puts element
end
# >> 100
# >> abc
# >> 200
# >> def
```

Then try adding an `#each` method to your linked list:

```ruby
list = LinkedList.new
list << 100 << 'abc' << 200 << 'def'
list.each do |element|
  puts element
end

# >> 100
# >> abc
# >> 200
# >> def
```

Then try writing a join method that uses the each method:

```ruby
list = LinkedList.new
list << 100 << 'abc' << 200 << 'def'

# get this one working first
list.join # => "100abc200def"

# then figure out what you need to change to get this one working
list.join('--') # => "100--abc--200--def"
```

When you finish, continue working on projects.


11:45 Practice Perfectian

$ rdms
```


12:00 Lunch

1:15 - EOD Project Work time and Checkins
-----------------------------------------

After your checkin, your group can allocate your time as you think is best.
But I'll advocate coming back for further checkins as you get the feedback implemented.

* 1:15 - Derreck, Dongmin, Vince
* 1:35 - Matthew, Greg, Sean
* 1:55 - Megan, James, Javi

Take these breaks

* 2:30 - Take a 10 minute walk around the block
  with your team and discuss what you're stuck on,
  what's going well, where you're going next.
* 3:30 - Same thing.


Homework
--------

* Finish your projects
