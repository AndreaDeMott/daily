8:00 Representing arrays under constraint
-----------------------------------------

Remember when we represented hashes with arrays, and arrays with hashes
[https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e90efc577610ce4e4341](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e90efc577610ce4e4341)

1. If all your arrays had to contain exactly 2 elements, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
2. If you could not use arrays at all, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
3. How would you add an element? How would you remove it?


9:00 Show off Your vim skills!
------------------------------

* x to delete a char
* u to undo
* ^ to go to the first character
* $ to go to the last character
* { to go to the previous empty line
* } to go to the next empty line


9:10 Practice Perfect
---------------------

Watch me create these structures using arrays, hashes, and objects.
Try to be able to do it in under 5 minutes.
Mad props if you can do it in under 4 minutes.


10:00 Show off the results of your practice
-------------------------------------------

* 1 hour explanation
* 1 hour
  * half: questions
  * half: material
* 30 min Q&A
* 1 hour
  * half: material
  * half: questions



10:00 Ruby... How does that work?!
----------------------------------

AKA the Object Model!

Homework
--------

### Waypoints:

* [Linked List](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/linked_lists.md)
* [Structuring data](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/structuring_data.md)
* [Cheatsheet internalization](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/core_structures.md)


### More vim:

Note: Pick just a few vim commands to try and use while you work on these.
I'll recommend:

* '>>` for indenting a line
* `<<` for outdenting a line
* `o` for going into insert mode on the next line

Don't forget to add them to your cheatsheet!


### Challenges:

* [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/command-line-arguments-homework.md)
* Stacks with hashes
* Stacks with objects

* Queues with hashes
* Queues with objects



Reflections

* When we looked at the http headers
  https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/dabc6894eb1696acbce2#http-requests
  we initially put each header in its own hash, which tripped us up.
  However other times, when we have arrays of hashes, it doesn't make sense to join them.
  * Give two examples of where it would make sense to join the arrays
  * Give two examples of where it would not
  * Come up with a rule for determining whether to combine them or not.

*

How would you represent:
  "A boy named Sue"

Object Model
  lexical scope?
  environment?
