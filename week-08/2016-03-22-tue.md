8:00 Assessment for last team
-----------------------------

8:00 Work on whatever's interesting to you!
-------------------------------------------

* I've added some challenges (IO, HTML, plus don't be afraid to revisit previous challenges now that you've learned more, you can refactor old solutions, or push further)
* You could push your app a bit further, eg do some of the refactorings I suggested
* Can you get Rails as far as I did?

### You could also do the Capybara Challenge!!

(I just made that up)

Install phantomjs, a js web browser:

```
$ brew install phantomjs
$ gem install capybara poltergeist
```

Then start a pry session and load up the internet!

```ruby
require 'capybara/poltergeist'
Capybara.default_driver = :poltergeist
page = Capybara.current_session
page.visit 'https://vimeo.com/home/myvideos'
```

Can you use [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) to find [Code Platoon's](https://vimeo.com/user47788820)

* shortest video?
* Longest video?
* Video with the most views?
* Video with the least views?
* Video with the most comments?
* Most recent video?
* First video?
* Can you use it to cheat at synseer? (you might have to go down to the driver for this one -- I haven't tried it yet)
