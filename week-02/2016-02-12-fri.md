Homework
--------

For Josh
--------

Waypoints on...

* File system?
* Can you think of a callstack waypoint? (self, method lookup, local variables?)

For students
------------

* Reflection: Little Book of Talent Tip #10,
  Honor the hard skills.
* Reflection: Little Book of Talent Tip #15,
  Break every move down into chunks.
* Complete all the synseer challenges.
  When you don't know the error, press "s"
  to see what it tells you the error should be
  (I know this isn't as helpful as it ought to be)
  Then, once you get through it, press "r" to redo
  and try to get through all from memory.
  Once you know what it should be, as you go through
  and make errors, keep a separate sheet and write
  down what the error is. From the Little Book of Talent
  tip #8, "To develop reliable hard skills,
  you need to connect the right wires in your brain.
  In this, it helps to be careful, slow, and keenly
  attuned to errors. To work like a careful carpenter."
  The purpose of writing down the errors is to
  help you be keenly attuned to them (this is how I
  got several of my 0 second results).
* Synseer get 3 results that have 0s
* Do all the mythical creature exercises.

  You'll need a test tool like `mrspec`!

  ```
  $ gem install mrspec rspec
  ```

  Then clone the code and run the tests

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises
  $ cd ruby-exercises/mythical-creatures
  $ mrspec unicorn_test.rb
  ```

  Then make it pass.
