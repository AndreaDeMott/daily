9:00 Work Time
--------------

When you have "work time" today, spend it on either
[building a gem day 3](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/building-a-gem/Day3.md),
or on [your project](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/notes-project.md).
Building a gem has the same structure and workflow as the one
you're working on, in fact, it's a harder program to write than the one you're doing.
So mine it heavily for ideas.
