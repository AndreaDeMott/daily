====================

8:00 Homework Review
--------------------

* Show that you have directories made for `~/cheatsheets`, `~/waypoints`, and `~/reflections`
* Files for the two "Little Book of Talent" reflections (Tips 4 and 11)
* Be able to do the vim waypoint in 3 minutes or less.

**Quiz**

* These ones have right answers.
  * What does it mean for a command to have a dollar sign in front of it?
  * What is a directory?
  * What is the command to change directories?
  * What is the command to make a directory?
  * What is the command to list the contents of a directory?
  * What is the command to start vim with a file?
  * What weird symbol is used to represent your home directory?
  * What are the two vim modes, and what are they for? (keep it terse)
  * What strings would these match? You can see a visualization at [http://regexper.com/](http://regexper.com/)
    * `ab[cd]ef`
    * `ab[cd]ef[gh]ij`
* These ones, the right answer is that you're not talking giberish
  * What patterns do you see in the JSON structures below? (find the balance between terse and descriptive)
  * Ignoring that the data *looked* different, how many different structures of data were there?
    ie if you were to make up your syntax (format of characters that make up the data, ie "then you have to have a comma"),
    how many different types of data would you have to make up syntax for?
  * If I said "There is a gem named Rails, written by David Heinemeier Hansson, that has been downloaded 60,439,139 times, and is on version 4.2.5.1",
    what would the JSON structure for that maybe look like?


Scattered Throughout the Day
----------------------------

TODO: Move this explanation off somewhere into curriculum.
Purpose of tools: Get them comfortable with their environment Ie what are files, programs, the shell, the terminal, how to run a program, how to navigate the file system. They will spend an exorbitant amount of time in this environment, so they need to be comfortable enough with it that it fades away and lets them focus on the challenge they are trying to solve.

* Typing practice
* Vim practice
* File system practice
* Run the SiB commands.


8:30 Seeing Is Believing
------------------------

9:00 Structures for Representing nouns
--------------------------------------

Structures for Representing Nouns Get them comfortable with JSON data structures. Here is a short example of what I expect some portion of it to look like: https://vimeo.com/151327704 (plus lots of quizzing throughout) Give them the tools to model the things they see. ie once comfortable with this, I can teach them Ruby like this: https://twitter.com/josh_cheek/status/627881347873243136 and they will know how to think about it. If I can't give them that, they will still be confused about instance variables vs local variables a month later, and will be trying to memorize thousands of contexts and rules to make sense of it. Once they understand how to work with these data structures, they can make sense of any topic by modeling the topic in them and then using their knowledge about how to work with them to understand how to work with the new topic. ie a directory is a hash, keys are filenames/dirnames, values are files/dirs. A path is an array of dirnames. The $PATH variable is an array of paths to look in when running programs, etc. I want this super early so that I can use it to make all future material simpler. I also want it rendered in many languages so that they see the underlying patterns of the structures (that it's about the relationships, not the syntax). Then, when I describe something abstract, like the object model, or the DOM, and they say "yeah, but what is it?" expecting something concrete, I can say "it's an idea, like a hash/obj/dictionary/associative array/key value pairs"

4:30 - 6:30 Mentor meetings
---------------------------

If your mentor is here, meet with them,
establish a good time and place to
work with your mentor, and a good place.


Homework
--------

* Repeat yesterday's [vim waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_first_steps.md)
  (less than 5 min)
* Do this other [vim "waypoint"](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_bare_minimum.md)
  (it's longer than I'd like waypoints to be, but w/e)
