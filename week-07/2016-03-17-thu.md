2:30 As many checkins as I can
------------------------------

* 15 min each, review the [project page](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/web_notes_project.md)
  as I added the matrix and moved some iterations into the extensions.
  Let me know with where you're at, if anything is blocking you, what you're stuck on.
  Keep in mind that we only have 15 min.
* Project will be due the 28th
* For everyone else, be sure you have these done.
  * Update your Rubocop config file since it had a bug in the configuration:
    https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/rubocop.yml
  * I updated the acceptance test to not upset Rubocop:
    https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/web_notes_acceptance_test.rb
    Get that working
