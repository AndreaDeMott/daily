=====================

8:00 Drawing!
-------------

Lets see how our understanding of the object model
allows us to make sense of what Ruby is doing.

* [The list](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/716db3c7f86bc9506c2b)
* [Video](https://vimeo.com/157347326) of building the list
* [Video](https://vimeo.com/157347327) of calling methods on the built list

10:00 Assessments / Challenges
------------------------------

[Challenges](https://github.com/JoshCheek/challenges)
These are taken from the ones we did last week. They're
just broken out into smaller pieces, and ordered in a
way that the slope is hopefully smoother.

I'm planning on adding more, as we hit new topics!


12:00 Lunch
-----------

1:00 Assessments / Challenges
-----------------------------

Continue from pre-lunch material

3:00 Reflection
---------------

* Reflection on how the project can improve
* Reflection on what our team did well and
  on what it struggled with and what could
  make it go better the next time


* Going well
  * Spent enough time with testing to learn a lot
  * The final assessment was informative / thought out
  * Nice solutions and fun assessments!
  * Found the project itself to have value (ie might use it!)
  * Doing a thing yourself, leads to dramatically better retention
    than my explaining it, even if done clearly.
  * Doing it in groups allowed us to rely on each other when we
    didn't know how to do something or were stuck.
* Going poorly
  * Not clear how the project is related to the Gitloc example
  * Wrong information given
    * Recursion
* Questions or `["stop", "start/keep doing", "do more"]`
  * Is there a way to walk through tutorials in the future?
  * Checkin time allowed the path to success to be tailored to where a group was at
  * Start the project earlier next time (thinks Josh)

* Gitloc tutorial:
  * In Day2, ["Code is requireable if its dir is in the $LOAD_PATH"](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/electives/building-a-gem/Day2.md#code-is-requireable-if-its-dir-is-in-the-load_path)
    * [Previous material](https://vimeo.com/155068283)
  * The approach to gitloc wasn't effective
    * Ie Gitloc did not contain the `realdirpath`
    * The Gitloc tutorial was difficult to parse
      (ie if the information was there, then it was too difficult to access)
  * Gitloc ideas we haven't seen
    * RSpec
    * Open3
    * Paths
    * Gem

4:00 HTTP exploration
---------------------

This will be valuable for the coding tonight.

6:00 - 9:00 Chicago Ruby - Josh livecodes a webserver
-----------------------------------------------------

Attend if it's right for you (it probably is, you're doing this project next week)
200 East Randolph Street (Aon Center), Chicago, IL

Homework
--------

If anyone is willing to look through the videos and dailies so far,
and identify topics and so forth that we can make challenges for,
that would be really heplful!
