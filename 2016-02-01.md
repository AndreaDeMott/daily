11:30 - Lunch Icebreaker
------------------------

Go get lunch somewhere and plan a social event for Friday...
y'all are going to spend a lot of time together,
so spend a bit learning to appreciate each other :)

We don't really care what it is, it's for you, without us.
Don't really care if you do it on Friday, either, as long
as it accomplishes the goal of building cohesion.

1:00 Mindset of a learner
-------------------------

[https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/mindset_of_a_learner.md](Mindset of a learner)

2:00ish Computer Setup
----------------------

This will be chaos. Your goal is to get a working, environment, not to understand everything that happens.

* [https://github.com/JoshCheek/1508/blob/master/initial-setup.md](initial setup)
* [https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles-for-students](student dotfiles)

Note that "dotfiles" are typically configuration files for the tools you use.


4:00 Explain homework
---------------------

So that you can make progress when we're not around.




Homework
========

There are a lot of things, but they're all small :)

### Have this by tomorrow:

Tomorrow, right away in the morning, you need to have:

* Directories made for `~/cheatsheets`, `~/waypoints`, and `~/reflections`
* Files for the two "Little Book of Talent" reflections.
* Be able to do the vim waypoint in 3 minutes or less.
* And we'll give you this quiz (placing this first instead of last to motivate you to engage with the material)
  * These ones have right answers.
    * What does it mean for a command to have a dollar sign in front of it?
    * What is a directory?
    * What is the command to change directories?
    * What is the command to make a directory?
    * What is the command to list the contents of a directory?
    * What is the command to start vim with a file?
    * What weird symbol is used to represent your home directory?
    * What are the two vim modes, and what are they for? (keep it terse)
  * These ones, the right answer is that you're not talking giberish
    * What patterns do you see in the JSON structures below? (find the balance between terse and descriptive)
    * Ignoring that the data *looked* different, how many different structures of data were there?
      ie if you were to make up your syntax (format of characters that make up the data, ie "then you have to have a comma"),
      how many different types of data would you have to make up syntax for?
    * If I said "There is a gem named Rails, written by David Heinemeier Hansson, that has been downloaded 60,439,139 times, and is on version 4.2.5.1",
      what would the JSON structure for that maybe look like?


### NOTE

Whenever you see a dollar sign in front of a command, it means that you should run the command
in your shell (that's the one where you interact with the computer by typing).


### Make some shit I want you to have, learn some shit you need to know

Start a cheatsheets directory (folder) for quickly referencing things you learn
Try to think about these as you do them (why did they name the commands that?)
In the next assignment, you'll have to do them again, so try to notice their strangeness,
and their similarities, and try to guess why the people who made them named them that way.

``` sh
# Go to your "home" directory (when used as a directory, the tilde represents yoru "home" directory)
# Note that there may be output when you run this command, which we're not showing.
$ cd ~

# Make a directory named cheatsheets
$ mkdir cheatsheets

# Move into that directory
$ cd cheatsheets

# Make files for various topics you are learning
$ touch vim unix jargon

# Make sure you see the files
$ ls -l
```

Add to these files as you learn new things.
Remember, these are cheatsheets, not essays, you want your notes to be as concise as possible.
Given that I felt obliged to put "folder" in parens above, it might be a reasonable thing to add to jargon


### Start a waypoints directory (folder)

Omg, lets do it agian!

* Go to your "home" directory
  * First, try to remember how to do this (we did it in the last assignment).
    Then give it a shot and see if you're right.
    If not, look above to see. Then try it, then try to do it again without looking.
* Make a directory named waypoints
  * Do the same thing here, try to remember before looking above.


### Vim: Your very first waypoint!

Waypoints are quick ways to take a big complex skill and boil it down to a few essentials,
they help establish a foundation you can build on.

Practice [this waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_first_steps.md)
until you can do the whole thing in under 3 minutes.
If you get confused, you can watch the 3 minute video of me doing it.


### Spaced learning

Stop and try to remember how to change directories, make a new one, and list the contents.
If you can't remember, look up above to see.
Now go ahead and do them, just to prove to yourself that you're correct :)


### Start a reflections directory (folder)

Do these from memory as best you can :)

* Go to your "home" directory
* Make a directory named reflections
* Make a directory named "little-book-of-talent"
* Change into that directory
* Use vim to make a file named tip-04


### Getting the right mindset: Little Book of Talent tip number 4

```sh
# Change into your little-book-of-talent directory
$ cd ~/reflections/little-book-of-talent

# Open tip-04 in vim
$ vim tip-04
```

Make sure you have the book, Rod sent it out in an email titled "Recommended Reading"
In Gmail, you can search for it with this URL:
[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#advanced-search/from=rodlevy1%40gmail.com&has=books+that+should+serve+you+well](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#advanced-search/from=rodlevy1%40gmail.com&has=books+that+should+serve+you+well)

Read "Tip #4, Buy a notebook".
Write a short paragraph about this. You can summarize them if you like,
you can think about how you're going to try to apply these ideas,
you can note how you agree with it or disagree with it,
The goal is for you to interact with the material in whatever form that takes.


### Practice that vim thing again

Remember, it should take just a few minutes. If not, practice it until you can do it that quickly.
We're building muscle memory here, caching things we'd otherwise spend way the hell too long thinking about!


### Immersion for tomorrow

There is a format for describing data that is called "JSON" (JavaScript Object Notation).
You can see an example of what it looks like by doing this:

```
$ curl 'https://api.github.com'
```

Spend several minutes looking at it and trying to find patterns in it. What kind of data does it hold?
Guess what you think the data is, and try to describe the format of it. What would it look like to add more data?

My github username is `JoshCheek`, and a repository that I own is `mrspec`.
Purely by guessing, from looking at the data you see on your screen, try to guess another URL that will work.
Prove to yourself that it does by using curl to request it.
Befoe you look at each one, try to guess what kind of information it might hold.
What are some words you might see on the screen?

If you can't figure it out, that's okay, but make sure you've tried at least 20 different options before you give up.
Is the spelling right? How come sometimes there's curly braces and sometimes there isn't? Why is the left side there?
Why is the right side there? etc.

If you do figure it out, look at the data on that page. In what ways does it look the way you expected?
In what ways does it differ?


### Mindset: Read "Tip #11, Don't fall for the prodigy myth"

Same as before, write a paragraph related to the material. No constraints on topic, form, etc. Your goal is to get something out of the material!


### Immersion:

Run each of these commands and compare the output.

```
$ curl 'https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rails.json' | ruby -r json -e 'puts JSON.pretty_generate JSON.parse $stdin.read'
$ curl 'https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rails.json' | ruby -r pp -r json -e 'pp JSON.parse $stdin.read'
$ curl 'https://rubygems.org/api/v1/gems/rails.yaml'
```

One of these is JSON, one is YAML, another is Ruby! Which do you think is which?
How are they similar to the one you saw earlier? How are they different?
How are they similar to each other? How are they different?
Spent at least 10 minutes writing down patterns in it.


### 3 more minutes doing that vim thing

Practice that vim thing again.
