Homework

* Reflection: "Dear Monday me, lets talk about TDD"
  Explain how to do TDD to Monday you, who didn't know anything about it.
* TDD a Linked List
  [Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/00d21eee2f59ddca82724e3964df847e17d812ab/phase1/linked_list_tdd.md)
  Be sure to commit it to git.
  Note that you can define the `<<` method like this:

  ```ruby
  def <<(arg)
    "You shoveled #{arg}"
  end

  self << 5  # => "You shoveled 5"
  ```

  Changed requirements! You only have to do these methods:

  ```
  []
  shift
  unshift
  ```
