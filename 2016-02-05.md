8:00 Representing arrays under constraint
-----------------------------------------

Remember when we represented hashes with arrays, and arrays with hashes
[https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e90efc577610ce4e4341](https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e90efc577610ce4e4341)

1. If all your arrays had to contain exactly 2 elements, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
2. If you could not use arrays at all, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
3. How would you add an element? How would you remove it?


9:00 Show off Your vim skills!
------------------------------

* x to delete a char
* u to undo
* C-R to redo
* ^ to go to the first character
* $ to go to the last character
* { to go to the previous empty line
* } to go to the next empty line
* C-C will also get you out of insert mode


9:10 Practice Perfect
---------------------

Omg, you all have SiB!

Watch me create these structures using arrays, hashes, and objects.
Try to be able to do it in under 5 minutes.
Mad props if you can do it in under 4 minutes.

10:00 Show off the results of your practice
-------------------------------------------

Your turn!


10:00 Ruby... How does that work?!
----------------------------------

AKA the Object Model!

* Show Ruby code (OO waypoint)
* Harvest challenges from ruby-submissions
[material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/how-ruby-works.md)
* Incorporate quizzes
* Daily: By weeks


* 1 hour explanation
* 1 hour
  * half: questions
  * half: material
* 30 min Q&A
* 1 hour
  * half: material
  * half: questions


1:00 Check ins
--------------

* Generate groups
* The rest of y'all, Read the Little Book of Talent tip #7,
  Then get together and organize everything you can think of
  within the context of your learning at Code Platoon,
  into hard and soft skills.
* Then read Tip #8, and discuss how to apply that to the
  the skills you identified.
* Then go do what you identified for a period of time that is appropriate.
* At the end, document your results (thoughts / reflections)
* If we're still not back, do this for tip #9

2:00
------------






* SiB working on all computers
* Highlighting on all computers
* Fill in next week together



Homework
--------

For Josh: Disable arrow keys in vim

For students:

### Waypoints:

* [Linked List](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/linked_lists.md)
* [Structuring data](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/structuring_data.md)
* [OO waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/object_oriented_programming.md)
* [Cheatsheet internalization](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/core_structures.md)
* Do these vim things in under 2 minutes

  * h to go left
  * j to go down
  * k to go up
  * l to go right
  * i for insert
  * Esc for normal mode
  * C-C will also get you out of insert mode
  * x to delete a char
  * u to undo
  * C-R to redo
  * ^ to go to the first character
  * $ to go to the last character
  * { to go to the previous empty line
  * } to go to the next empty line
  * `>>` for indenting a line
  * `<<` for outdenting a line
  * `o` for going into insert mode on the next line

  If you can do all of these in under 90 seconds, I'll give you...

  * Copy a line
  * Delete a line
  * Paste the line you copied


Don't forget to add them to your cheatsheet!


### Challenges:

* [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/command-line-arguments-homework.md)


### Reflections

* When we looked at the http headers
  https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/dabc6894eb1696acbce2#http-requests
  we initially put each header in its own hash, which tripped us up.
  However other times, when we have arrays of hashes, it doesn't make sense to join them.
  * Give two examples of where it would make sense to join the arrays
  * Give two examples of where it would not
  * Come up with a rule for determining whether to combine them or not.


### Josh TODO

* Stacks
  * Stacks with hashes
  * Stacks with objects
* Queues
  * Queues with hashes
  * Queues with objects
* Add:
