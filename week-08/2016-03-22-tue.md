8:00 Assessment for last team
-----------------------------

8:00 Work on whatever's interesting to you!
-------------------------------------------

* I've added some challenges (IO, HTML, plus don't be afraid to revisit previous challenges now that you've learned more, you can refactor old solutions, or push further)
* You could push your app a bit further, eg do some of the refactorings I suggested
* Can you get Rails as far as I did?
* You could also do the Capybara Challenge!! [Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase2/capybara_challenge1.md)

2:30 Build Scaffold
-------------------

Do it along with me.

* New project
* Add mrspec, capybara, pry, rubocop
* Generate a scaffold for our notes and see what it does
* Use that as a guide to make our own

Topics: ActiveRecord, migrations, models ActiveRecord in Rails migrations, config

Play with the [playground](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase2/active_record_playground.rb)
