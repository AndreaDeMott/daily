===================

[Reference](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum#week-2)


8:00 Perform Waypoints
-----------------------

* [Linked List](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/linked_lists.md)
* [Structuring data](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/structuring_data.md)
* [OO waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/object_oriented_programming.md)
* [Cheatsheet internalization](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/core_structures.md)
* [Vim common keybindings](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_common_keybindings.md)

If y'all do well on these, maybe we can adjust tomorrow's
schedule to attend [Geekfest](http://www.meetup.com/Geekfest/events/226805156/)!


9:00 Up to an hour of review on homework
----------------------------------------

* [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/command-line-arguments-homework.md)
* Reflection on joining arrays


10:00 Synseer and typing speed test
-----------------------------------

Here is a game I made to help you learn Ruby syntax:
http://synseer.herokuapp.com/

Work on them together in these groups (you can collaborate outside the group if you both get stuck),
Note that you can try a game as many times as you like, there is no cost to playing multiple times
(you can only improve). Be sure to pay attention, I'm going to assign it as homework for each of you,
and might make it a waypoint at some point :P

```
['Dongmin', 'Vince', 'James', 'Javi', 'Derreck', 'Megan', 'Sean', 'Matthew', 'Greg'].shuffle.each_slice(2)
```

While working on that, I'm going to come around and do a typing speed test with each of you
to see where you're at with that.


Fix any remaining environment issues
------------------------------------

Ben Cornelius from [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/),
is coming to help fix any environment issues!
Be sure to write down a list of issues, so we are prepared.

* SiB working in vim?
* Vim working? (can you edit files? are they highlighted?)
* Package managers working?
* Anything else?
* (what's the chruby complaint about? -- maybe `$SHELL` is messed up?)

Try to end a bit early, b/c we're lunching early.


11:50 Lunch
-----------

Eat food yo!
Be back before 1:00, b/c we want to be considerate to Todd!


1:00 - 3:00 Leadership
----------------------

Todd Connor, CEO of the Bunker, and Navy veteran,
is here to tell y'all to get your shit together!
;)


3:00 Oh No, Control Flow!
--------------------------

You're going to have to write a reflection about this at the end!


3:30 Reflection
---------------

Write reflections about these topics:

* Explain how `&&` works (what are the rules for figuring out what it will do?)
* Explain how `||` works (include an example and walk through how Ruby evaluates the example)
* What is the difference between `if` and `while`?
* What is the difference between `unless` and `until?


4:00 Wait, How Does Ruby Work Again?
-------------------------------

Lets cover more of that stuff we talked about on Friday.

Either more "how ruby works" or something that uses
objects in conjunction with other objects.


Homework
--------

### Cheatsheet improvement

Spend 30 minutes Skimming through the docs,
find 5 methods that you think are worth memorizing next
Add them to your cheatsheet. Come prepared to share.

* http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Array
* http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Hash
* http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/String
* http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/core/Integer


### Synseer

Complete this, through "require statements" by tomorrow.


### Improve your typing

[Here](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/prework-practice-typing.md)
is the material for improving your typing.

If you're one of these humans, improve your typing speed by 3 wpm.
I'm going to measure you again on Friday:

* Names
* Will
* Go
* Here

If you're one of these humans, go through [this tutor](https://www.typingclub.com).
You need to show me that you're going through it, and to improve your typing speed by
3 WPM by Friday:

* Names
* Will
* Go
* Here
