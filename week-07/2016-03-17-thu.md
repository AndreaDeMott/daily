1:30 Checkins
-------------

* 20 min each
* Project will be due the 28th
* For everyone else, be sure to do these:
  * Update your Rubocop config file since it had a bug in the configuration:
    https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/rubocop.yml
  * I updated the acceptance test to not upset Rubocop:
    https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/web_notes_acceptance_test.rb
    Get that working
  * I added a matrix, and moved some iterations into extensions,
    so check the [project page](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/web_notes_project.md)
    again.
