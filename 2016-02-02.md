8:00 Homework Review
--------------------

* Show that you have directories made for `~/cheatsheets`, `~/waypoints`, and `~/reflections`
* Files for the two "Little Book of Talent" reflections (Tips 4 and 11)
* Be able to do the vim waypoint in 3 minutes or less.

**Quiz**

* These ones have right answers.
  * What does it mean for a command to have a dollar sign in front of it?
  * What is a directory?
  * What is the command to change directories?
  * What is the command to make a directory?
  * What is the command to list the contents of a directory?
  * What is the command to start vim with a file?
  * What weird symbol is used to represent your home directory?
  * What are the two vim modes, and what are they for? (keep it terse)
  * What strings would these match? You can see a visualization at [http://regexper.com/](http://regexper.com/)
    * `ab[cd]ef`
    * `ab[cd]ef[gh]ij`
* These ones, the right answer is that you're not talking giberish
  * What patterns do you see in the JSON structures below? (find the balance between terse and descriptive)
  * Ignoring that the data *looked* different, how many different structures of data were there?
    ie if you were to make up your syntax (format of characters that make up the data, ie "then you have to have a comma"),
    how many different types of data would you have to make up syntax for?
  * If I said "There is a gem named Rails, written by David Heinemeier Hansson, that has been downloaded
    60,439,139 times, and is on version 4.2.5.1", what would the JSON structure for that maybe look like?

The structures we made up.

* Name
* SKU (stock keeping unit)
* Coin Flip
* Warehouses
* Boxes
* Floor space

1:00 Continue Structures for Representing nouns / Cheatsheets
-------------------------------------------------------------

* Continue working on the cheatsheets
* Create your own
* Add a reflection in `~/reflections/core_structures` where you
  answer the questions in the reflect section.


The Power and Danger of Abstractions
------------------------------------

[Material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/the_power_and_danger_of_abstractions.md)

The structures we learned today will serve us very well.
They give us an ability to understand relationships that is incredibly powerful.
But always keep in mind, when learning any abstraction,
that there are ways it is not true, and there are costs to using it.
For now, the advantages tremendously outweigh the disadvantages,
but when you have demonstrated competence with them, you can ask me how they work,
and we will go to a land where they do not exist.
Pop open the hood and understand how they work.


4:30 - 6:30 Mentor meetings
---------------------------

If your mentor is here, meet with them,
establish a good time and place to
work with your mentor, and a good place.


Homework
--------

* Repeat yesterday's [vim waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_first_steps.md)
  (less than 5 min)
* Do this other [vim "waypoint"](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/vim_getting_started.md)
  (it's longer than I'd like waypoints to be, but w/e)
* Make a cheatsheet for "unix", and add in explanations and examples of how to use each of these.
  Don't look at documentation. You can look at material we've given you, but mostly you should figure out how they work by
  experimenting with them, hypothesize how they work, trying some examples that should and should not be true.
  Use science to figure out how it works :) Don't worry if you're correct or not, according to someone else's statement,
  it is more valuable to make sense of it yourself than it is to be objectively correct. That will come with time, regardless,
  but your understanding will be much much deeper.

  * `pwd`
  * `cd`
  * `ls`
  * `rm`
  * `ln`
  * `mkdir`
  * `curl`
  * And I haven't told you this one yet, but there is a program named `cat`.  It expects filenames as arguments.
* What would `12[abc]67` match?
* Complete the [banking homework] (https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/banking-homework.md)in ruby (6 or 7 programs)
