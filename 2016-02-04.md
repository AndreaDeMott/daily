=====================

To be organized:

* Ruby's object model. The simple / elegant explanation of how Ruby works, based on three structures. They can understand the stack because it's just a linked list. They can understand inheritance, because it's just a linked list. I'll give them the main 3 structures and then tons of questions and challenges that they can only answer by using the model (the 3 structures). If they do well at this, they will know how Ruby works better than many people who've been writing it for years. I might also give them tools for reflection, so they can query the system to get feedback to validate their thoughts.

Push to later
  * Run the SiB commands.

Uhm, organize this:
  TODO: Move this explanation off somewhere into curriculum.
  Purpose of tools:
    Get them comfortable with their environment Ie what are files, programs, the shell, the terminal,
    how to run a program, how to navigate the file system.
    They will spend an exorbitant amount of time in this environment,
    so they need to be comfortable enough with it that it fades away and lets them focus on the challenge they are trying to solve.
  * File system practice
  * Linked Lists If they understand the JSON data structures, then this is an opportunity to use that
    knowledge of modeling. A linked list is a very useful data structure to understand, and it's very simple.
    You can represent it with arrays [1, [2, [3, nil]]] or hashes:
    {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}} or give it a base to wrap the nodes:
    {head: {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}}}.
    Then have them play with it to show they can get any arbitrary piece of data out,
    or put new pieces of data in. Do this in SiB, where feedback is effective.
    Then have them build methods to abstract the process. Maybe have them build a stack out of it,
    to prepare for the object model.
