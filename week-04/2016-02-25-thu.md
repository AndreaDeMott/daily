to know about?

5 min each in the following order:

```ruby

# => ["Megan", "Sean", "Greg", "Javi", "Dongmin", "Derreck", "Matthew", "James", "Vince"]
```

```

[Here](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/fcbb6056331cf6068fb5b937967bd385625613a5/phase1/vim_nerdtree.md)

You can also work on linked lists, if you think that will be more valuable.


3:00 Yoga
---------

Wear loose comfortable clothing.
The mats are kindly provided by the veteran's yoga project,
if you think the experience has value, consider [donating](http://www.veteransyogaproject.org/donate.html),
or sending them a "thanks" on [twitter](https://twitter.com/veteransyoga).

6:00 - 7:00 Chicago Ruby
------------------------

Consider attending [this meetup!](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoRuby/events/224393434/)


Homework
--------

* [linked list](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/linked_list_tdd.md).
  all of `[]`, `<<`, `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift`.
  Props if you can also get `delete_at`.

  **Difference from the challenges**: we're calling the methods
  on the list, so you'll implement it inside the list,
  and your data will be stored in instance variables instead of
  local variables.
* Building a gem day 3. You can skip this one if you go to the ChicagoRuby meetup.
  You can skip the "Finale! Anatomy of a .gem file",
  we [already saw that](https://vimeo.com/155068252).
