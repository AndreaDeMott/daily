* Vim waypoint! Plus these three:
  * x to delete a char
  * u to undo
  * ^ to go to the first character
  * $ to go to the last character
  * { to go to the previous empty line
  * } to go to the next empty line
* Sign up for 8LU / Chi Ruby
* Quick, lets make sense of this:

  ```
  ./
  ├── a/
  │   ├── f
  │   ├── lol/
  │   │   ├── x
  │   │   ├── y
  │   │   └── z
  │   ├── r
  │   ├── t
  │   └── wtf/
  ├── b/
  └── c/
      └── bbq/
  ```
* And the output of this: `$ curl -i http://google.com`
* `$ mkdir a c a/lol a/wtf` and `$ ls -l -a` and `$ clear`
* Predict arguments!
* Play with Chunky PNG!
  * `$ gem install chunky_png`
  * Here's the code we came up with! https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/7c4fa63e81c5d73ec444

Homework

I'd like y'all to have your cheatsheets complete and to contemplate these questions (don't look up the answer, thinking really hard about how to do it is good for you, even if you don't get it... I'm not interested in a "right" answer, I'm interested in whether you can come up with something creative enough to solve the problem! If you've been working hard already (I see Dongmin is still here) then get some rest, but try to spend at least 30 minutes on it in the morning :simple_smile:

Remember when we represented hashes with arrays, and arrays with hashes (https://gist.github.com/JoshCheek/e90efc577610ce4e4341)

1. If all your arrays had to contain exactly 2 elements, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
2. If you could not use arrays at all, how would you represent an array of arbitrary length?
3. How would you add an element? How would you remove it?
