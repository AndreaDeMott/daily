8:00 Share your "I wish everyone knew"s
---------------------------------------

From yesterday's homework, what was the thing you found that you
think is really valuable and would like everyone else in the class
to know about?

5 min each in the following order:

```ruby
%w[Dongmin Vince James Javi Derreck Megan Sean Matthew Greg].shuffle
# => ["Megan", "Sean", "Greg", "Javi", "Dongmin", "Derreck", "Matthew", "James", "Vince"]
```


9:00 Work time
--------------

Work on Building a Gem day 3 and your projects.


10:00 Christopher Miller

From the Road Home to Present (short)


10:30 Vim Goodies
-----------------

Next vim keybindings

```ruby
[ 'Fix my terrible indentation, pls, vim',
  'NERDtree',
  'vertical editing',
  'Scroll up / down',
  'substitute',
  'realign',
].sample
# => "NERDtree"
```

Install it by adding this plugin:

```vim
Plugin 'https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree'             " Tree Display for the file system
```

Then restarting vim and running:

```
:VundleInstall
```

Here is how I configured it (add to the bottom of your ~/.vimrc)

```vim
" Open a NERDTree automatically when vim starts up if no files were specified
autocmd StdinReadPre * let s:std_in=1
autocmd VimEnter * if argc() == 0 && !exists("s:std_in") | NERDTree | endif

" Close vim if NERDTree is the only open buffer
autocmd bufenter * if (winnr("$") == 1 && exists("b:NERDTree") && b:NERDTree.isTabTree()) | q | endif

" Thanks, James!
nmap <C-N> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
```

* Now you can switch NERDtree on and off with `C-n`.
* Jump between screens with `C-h` and `C-l` (Assuming you have my dotfiles, `C-w h` and `C-w l` otherwise)
* Normal navigation within NERDtree (hjkl)
* Open a directory by placing the cursor on it and pressing `o`
* Open the file in the current window with `o`
* Open the file in a vertical split with `s`
* Open the file in a horizontal split with `i`
* Get a list of stuff you can do with `?` (press again to get back)
