Add
  Needs a home
    * File system practice
  Drop anywhere
    * Typing practice
    * Vim practice

Push to later
  * Run the SiB commands.

Uhm, organize this:
  TODO: Move this explanation off somewhere into curriculum.
  Purpose of tools:
    Get them comfortable with their environment Ie what are files, programs, the shell, the terminal,
    how to run a program, how to navigate the file system.
    They will spend an exorbitant amount of time in this environment,
    so they need to be comfortable enough with it that it fades away and lets them focus on the challenge they are trying to solve.


* Representing nouns Recap yesterday's material (JSON data structures)
  and then use the tools to render lots of examples in JSON. I'm thinking some English phrases,
  get them to recognize that plurality implies a collection, nonexistence implies nil/null,
  anything with a name implies a hash, words imply strings, yes/no implies true/false, etc.
  Then have them model many of the things they are using. eg the file system, HTML, HTTP, etc.
  So they will build competence with this skill while also learning about these domains.
  This will reduce the scariness / newness of those systems. I generally want to avoid teaching them
  topics in favour of teaching them techniques so they can teach themselves the topic.

* Linked Lists If they understand the JSON data structures, then this is an opportunity to use that
  knowledge of modeling. A linked list is a very useful data structure to understand, and it's very simple.
  You can represent it with arrays [1, [2, [3, nil]]] or hashes:
  {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}} or give it a base to wrap the nodes:
  {head: {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}}}.
  Then have them play with it to show they can get any arbitrary piece of data out,
  or put new pieces of data in. Do this in SiB, where feedback is effective.
  Then have them build methods to abstract the process. Maybe have them build a stack out of it,
  to prepare for the object model.

* Write a linked list
  * Do these
    * prepend
    * find
    * insert
    * delete
  * Stretch
    * append

Josh Recap structures

9:00 Teambuilding
-----------------

With Len Harris.


10:30 Homework Review
---------------------

7 banking problems:  each student will take one
and present their code for it at the podium.  One
other student will lead the discussion of alternative
approaches--how else can the problem be solved?

Ray Krueger's personal story.

Homework
--------

* When we were making sense of the structures for representing nouns,
  we created our own terminology that allowed us to relate it to concepts we already understood
  (warehouses, boxes, floor space, etc). Now, spend 30 minutes to 1.5 hours, creating your own
  syntax for it. The syntax is the way that the representation looks. We saw atht hashes looked
  different in Ruby vs JSON vs YAML, well there's no "right" way for it to look, you can make
  up your own! You could use different characters than curly braces around hashes (we saw that YAML
  used the existence of key/value pairs for this, without curly braces at all), you can use commas
  if you like them, or colons to split keys and values like JSON and YAML, or hash rockets like Ruby,
  or you could make up your own new idea! You can do arrays with commas between elements, or with
  bullets out front, or whatever you like! Make it your own!
* Reflection: structures for modeling nouns
  * Compare implementations
    * What are the similarities?
    * What are the differences
  * The structures
    * Which is your favourite (and why)?
    * Why these structures?
    * Can you think of any other types of data that we don't have a structure for?
    * What would we lose if we removed some of these?
  * Look up the words "syntax" and "semantics" and write down the definitions.
    Which part of what you learned today is syntax? Which part is semantics?
    Include specific examples.
  * Why are we starting here and not somewhere else?
  * Modeling (describing relationships)
    * How could you represent this sentence in Ruby: My friend's name is, Janet.
    * Find a real-world example that you can describe with these, similar to mine (maybe a sports team or the train system)
    * Can you think of any real-world examples that you can't describe with these types?
  * Are all collections of names ordered?
    * If they are, how come?
    * If they aren't, do you lose or gain anything?
