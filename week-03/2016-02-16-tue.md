Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkEZEpFU4m4&index=4&list=PLEo7ej2RhHszJy_77UXC8GJpb8LtW-dJT)
video and explain how "Following the flow of ideas" is dramatically better than memorizing every situation.


Moar object model!
------------------

* How the hell does `self` return `main` when I inspect it?
* What about that `File.exist?` thing? Where is that method?
* What if I want to share methods between classes?  How would I do that?
