====================

We're pushing AR to next week b/c I added it to the project and thought it was too much cost with too little value.

8:00 Synseer / Vim
------------------

Go through synseer the way you did Tuesday,
paying attention to the names and the words,
and not worrying about speed,
(though note that you can always press "r" to redo it, if you think it'd be easy to get a better one)

After that, share vim tips, and ask each other to watch your vim and provide suggestions.
How can we move towards [system1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow#Two_systems)
competence?


9:30 Work on what is valuable
-----------------------------

I'll be available for checkins and to help you past hurdles.


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Enjoy caloric compensation.

2:00 Refactoring or Checkins

If I can think of some good refactoring material,
we can do that. Otherwise checkins.
