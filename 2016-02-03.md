=====================

Add
  Needs a home
    * File system practice
  Drop anywhere
    * Typing practice
    * Vim practice

Push to later
  * Run the SiB commands.

Uhm, organize this:
  TODO: Move this explanation off somewhere into curriculum.
  Purpose of tools:
    Get them comfortable with their environment Ie what are files, programs, the shell, the terminal,
    how to run a program, how to navigate the file system.
    They will spend an exorbitant amount of time in this environment,
    so they need to be comfortable enough with it that it fades away and lets them focus on the challenge they are trying to solve.


* Representing nouns Recap yesterday's material (JSON data structures)
  and then use the tools to render lots of examples in JSON. I'm thinking some English phrases,
  get them to recognize that plurality implies a collection, nonexistence implies nil/null,
  anything with a name implies a hash, words imply strings, yes/no implies true/false, etc.
  Then have them model many of the things they are using. eg the file system, HTML, HTTP, etc.
  So they will build competence with this skill while also learning about these domains.
  This will reduce the scariness / newness of those systems. I generally want to avoid teaching them
  topics in favour of teaching them techniques so they can teach themselves the topic.

* Linked Lists If they understand the JSON data structures, then this is an opportunity to use that
  knowledge of modeling. A linked list is a very useful data structure to understand, and it's very simple.
  You can represent it with arrays [1, [2, [3, nil]]] or hashes:
  {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}} or give it a base to wrap the nodes:
  {head: {data: 1, link: {data: 2, link: {data: 3, link: nil}}}}.
  Then have them play with it to show they can get any arbitrary piece of data out,
  or put new pieces of data in. Do this in SiB, where feedback is effective.
  Then have them build methods to abstract the process. Maybe have them build a stack out of it,
  to prepare for the object model.

* Write a linked list
  * Do these
    * prepend
    * find
    * insert
    * delete
  * Stretch
    * append


8:00 Recap

Josh Recap structures

9:00 Teambuilding
-----------------

With Len Harris.


10:30 Homework Review
---------------------

7 banking problems:  each student will take one
and present their code for it at the podium.  One
other student will lead the discussion of alternative
approaches--how else can the problem be solved?

12:00 Lunch

Catered by LETTUCE / Big City Chicken.

(Josh will be out)

1:00 Looping
------------

* Make sure cheatsheets are complete up to this point

4:00 - 5:00 Military to Coding
------------------------------

Ray Krueger's personal story.

Homework
--------

* Add a reflection in `~/reflections/my_core_structures` where you
  describe the representation that you made up.
  Be sure to explain the difference between the syntax and the semantics.
* Use the structures we defined today to describe the structures you see in each of these.
  Bonus points if you can come up with multiple representations.

  * `$ echo $PATH`
  * `$ curl -i http://google.com'
  * A url with query parameters (eg search for something on Amazon.com)
