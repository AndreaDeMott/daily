8:00 Waypoints
--------------

* We'll document time to completion, and then make a goal of improving by Friday.
* These are the constraints:
  * No reference material, it will be done from memory
  * Syntax highlighting (ie save as a `linked_list.rb` file extension)
  * No errors
  * Under x minutes
* [Linked List](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/linked_lists.md)
* [Structuring data](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/structuring_data.md)
* [OO waypoint](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/object_oriented_programming.md)
* [Cheatsheet internalization](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/core_structures.md)


Planning
--------

* Document times for each waypoint.

Unix
----

Go through [this material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/unix1.md)


Drop these in here somewhere
----------------------------

* Typing racer
* Which cheatsheet ideas?
* boolean quiz?


Ruby ecosystem
--------------

```ruby
# Say you had a class for Bill Clinton
# By convention, everyone, and you, as well,
# uses camel case like this:
class BillClinton
end

# for a local variable, use snake case
bill_clinton = BillClinton.new

# and this whole thing would go in a snake case file with a .rb extension
# bill_clinton.rb
```


12:00 Lunch
-----------

Instructors will be out for lunch with
Travis Dent to discuss agile development.


Hit up object model again
-------------------------

[https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/how-ruby-works.md](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/how-ruby-works.md)

You can get access to the stack code we used:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:JoshCheek/object-model-with-lovisa.git
```


Homework
--------

### Finish Unix code from before lunch

Finish the [Command Line material](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/unix1.md)
(it will be worth it).


### Write some programs and make your own waypoint

Write some of the programs you've been using.
Go through the waypoints with me for
[echo](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/echo.md),
[cat](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cat.md),
and [cp](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/cp.md)

Then write your own. Some examples that will be useful are in the description.
(how to read (load) / write (save) / and delete files, how to list out a directory)

### Work on your typing for 15-30 minutes

* [Prework](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/prework-practice-typing.md)
* [Tutor](https://www.typingclub.com).


### Generate these errors

Yo, make Ruby blow up in [these ways!](https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/make_a_program_that_blows_up_like_this.md)
