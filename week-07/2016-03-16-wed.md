Homework
--------

* Update your Rubocop config file since it had a bug in the configuration:
  https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/rubocop.yml
* I updated the acceptance test to not upset Rubocop:
  https://github.com/CodePlatoon/curriculum/blob/master/phase1/web_notes_acceptance_test.rb
  Get that working
* Use the knowledge you gained today to improve the HTML you're using to render your notes!
  Don't worry about testing the presentation, the test should just make sure that the right
  data makes it onto the page, there's no real value to testing how it is laid out, or its appearance.
