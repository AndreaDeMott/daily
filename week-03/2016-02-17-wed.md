8:00 Some useful keybindings
----------------------------

If you don't have a cheatsheet for shell keybindings, start one now!

* Vim: `C-z` (control z) to put vim into the background
* Shell: `C-p` go to the previous line
* Shell: `$ fg` bring vim back to the foreground

So, to rerun a test from vim:

* `C-z` to put it into the background and go to the shell
* `C-p` to go up to the line that got you into vim
* `C-p` to go up to the line that ran your tests (assuming you ran it just before going into vim)
* Return to rerun the test command.


8:10 Waypoints
--------------

Perform the testing waypoint, try to use the keybindings we just learned
Be able to do the [How Testing Works](https://github.com/turingschool/waypoints/blob/master/waypoints/how_testing_works.md)
waypoint.
